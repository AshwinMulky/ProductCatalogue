# ProductCatalogue
This application was generated using JHipster 4.14.1, you can find documentation and help at [http://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v4.14.1](http://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v4.14.1).

This is a "microservice" application intended to be part of a microservice architecture, please refer to the [Doing microservices with JHipster][] page of the documentation for more information.

This application is configured for Service Discovery and Configuration with the JHipster-Registry. On launch, it will refuse to start if it is not able to connect to the JHipster-Registry at [http://localhost:8761](http://localhost:8761). For more information, read our documentation on [Service Discovery and Configuration with the JHipster-Registry][].



## About MicroService
Product Catalogue Service
Microservice that provides the functionality to
- Add a product
- Retrieve the list of products based on simple search criteria e.g. product type
- Remove a product from the catalogue.

### Features
- Service discovery server : Jhipster registry
- Type of Authentication : JWT
- Database : MongoDB
- Ehcache : Hazelcast
- Build tool : Gradle
- Running port : 8081

> NOTE: If your are just trying to test the API calls without Jhipster registry then, comment line num 63 and uncomment line num 64 in the below java file.
com.globomart.catalogue.config.MicroserviceSecurityConfiguration

             //.antMatchers("/api/**").authenticated() //Authentication appens through registry
             .antMatchers("/api/**").permitAll()  // Authentication not required

### REST APIs
* GET /api/products
* POST /api/products
* DELETE /api/products/{product_id}
* PUT /api/products
* GET /api/products/{id}
* GET /api/products/search (search based on product type)

## Development

To start your application in the dev profile, simply run:

    ./gradlew


> This microservice assumes that there is a Jhipster registry running, hence it continuesly tries to register itself with registry. You may see some errors like below. It is okay. APIs will work fine.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].



## Building for production

To optimize the productCatalogue application for production, run:

    ./gradlew -Pprod clean bootRepackage

To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar build/libs/*.war


Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./gradlew test

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a mongodb database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./gradlew bootRepackage -Pprod buildDocker

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
